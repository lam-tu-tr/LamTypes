## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built from scratch in 2 weeks, this project kicked started my web development journey by demanding the need to solve fundamental design problems without the aid of any other packages. I manipulated the text using Query Selectors 
and validated user input using Javascript. The inspirational quotes were fetched from an API, which was then displayed for the user to type. 

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to manipulate DOM elements using JS, fetch from an API, and use AddEventListeners to listen for user inputs. I really enjoyed working on this project while figuring out the intricacies of working with the basics of basics. Looking back, I had finished this project without knowing the existence of React or any other frontend frameworks. Because of this, I learned to appreciate React and how it helps developers speed up code and optimize for performance without the nitty gritty verbose details.

## Examples:
