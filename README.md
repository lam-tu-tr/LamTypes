## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built from scratch in 2 weeks, this project kicked started my web development journey by demanding the need to solve fundamental design problems without the aid of any other packages. I manipulated the text using Query Selectors
and validated user input using Javascript. The inspirational quotes were fetched from an API, which was then displayed for the user to type.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to manipulate DOM elements using JS, fetch from an API, and use AddEventListeners to listen for user inputs. I really enjoyed working on this project while figuring out the intricacies of working with the basics of basics. Looking back, I had finished this project without knowing the existence of React or any other frontend frameworks. Because of this, I learned to appreciate React and how it helps developers speed up code development and optimize for performance without the nitty gritty verbose details.

Edit:
I decided to come back to this project after about a year to make it responsive, which I neglected to do when I was starting out. Having coded more complex projects and developed my own CSS understanding and pattern, it so clear how poorly coded and convoluted my CSS and HTML code were. I noticed a lot of unnessary divs and classes that were redundant, which I had to clean up.

After completing my portfolio with what I think was my best CSS and HTML practice yet, I learned that less is definitely more.
